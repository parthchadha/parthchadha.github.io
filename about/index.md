I am a Deep Learning Software Engineer at NVIDIA. Before joining NVIDIA, I worked as a ML engineer at [Markov Corporation](https://level.ai/engineers/2019/1/27/j28w3xrp8m1x4xmkdw7zzkz2svq2j6). I received my Masters in ECE from Carnegie Mellon University where I explored Machine Learning and the underlying systems design. 

Technical interests:

1. Systems for Machine/Deep Learning. How can you leverage most out of exisiting hardware.

2. LLMs: interpretability and exploring in-content learning.

3. Intersection of learnable machines with everything (biology, economics ...)

<!-- Some of the interesting courserwork I took at CMU include [Machine Learning 10-701](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10701-f16/),  [Deep Reinforcement Learning and Control](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/10-703/) and [Parallel Computer Architecture and Programming](http://15418.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2017/). -->
