## Intro
I am a first year Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University in [ECE](https://www.ece.cmu.edu) department exploring computer vision under [Prof. Gary Overett](http://gary.overett.org). I am part of the double degree program [JIE](http://jie.sysu.edu.cn) in partnership with Sun-Yat Sen University, Guangzhou. 
Starting from Fall'16, I will be in Pittsburgh campus.

Before joining CMU for graduate studies, I had been working on building [Affordable Refreshable braille display](http://assistech.iitd.ernet.in/index.php). I completed my undergraduate studies from [Delhi College of Engineering](http://dtu.ac.in), where my undergraduate thesis focussed on Biological inspired circuits and systems.
