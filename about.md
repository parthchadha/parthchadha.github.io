<!-- ## Introduction
 -->
I am a Deep Learning Software Engineer at NVIDIA. Before joining NVIDIA, I worked as a ML engineer at [Markov Corporation](https://level.ai/engineers/2019/1/27/j28w3xrp8m1x4xmkdw7zzkz2svq2j6). I received my Masters in ECE from Carnegie Mellon University where I explored Machine Learning and the underlying systems design. Some of the interesting courserwork I took at CMU include [Machine Learning 10-701](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10701-f16/),  [Deep Reinforcement Learning and Control](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/10-703/) and [Parallel Computer Architecture and Programming](http://15418.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2017/).

<!-- My course list at CMU 

1. [Machine Learning 10-701](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10701-f16/) [Project Report](ML701_final_report.pdf)
2. Real-Time Embedded Systems
3. [Distributed Systems](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~srini/15-440/syllabus.html)
4. Computer Architecture
5. Computer Vision
6. How to Write Fast Code


I worked under [Prof. Gary Overett](http://gary.overett.org) for my research work on Recurrent Attention Models. [Thesis Link](thesis.pdf) [Experiment Link](smnist.gif).

Before joining CMU for graduate studies, I had been working on building [Affordable Refreshable braille display](http://assistech.iitd.ernet.in/index.php). I completed my undergraduate studies from [Delhi College of Engineering](http://dtu.ac.in), where my undergraduate thesis focussed on Biological inspired circuits and systems.

I presented my work on using novel discrete memristor to develop applications such programmable analog circuits at MemTDAC workshop, HiPEAC Conference'14. [Paper Link](paper1.pdf)
